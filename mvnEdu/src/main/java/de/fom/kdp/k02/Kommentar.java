 *
 * Hints for Javadocs: <br>
 * 1) Introduce a class header with a single line of documentation ("First
 * Sentence") and an &#64;author tag at a minimum. <br>
 * 2) Add as many documentation up the hierarchy as possible. Use
 * {&#64;inheritDoc} down the hierarchy. <br>
 * 3) Document all public methods except getters and setters with at last a
 * single line and add &#64;throws and &#64;return. &#64;params only if they are
 * not obvious. <br>
 * 4) Use &#64;link as internal reference and &#64;see to add references to
 * external resources. <br>
 * 5) Javadocs should get peer-reviewed, just like code.

	 * Mehrzeiliger Kommentar ... When it comes to writing Javadoc comments, there
	 * are several best practices that can help improve the readability and
	 * usefulness of your documentation. Here are some guidelines to follow: 1. Use
	 * Javadoc for Public and Protected Members: Javadoc is primarily intended for
	 * documenting public and protected members (classes, methods, fields). Private
	 * members don't typically need Javadoc comments since they are usually only
	 * relevant within the class itself. 2. Document the Purpose and Behavior:
	 * Clearly describe the purpose and behavior of the element being documented.
	 * Explain what it does, its expected inputs, and the output or side effects.
	 * Use clear and concise language. 3. Follow the Javadoc Format: Javadoc
	 * comments should follow a specific format. Start with a summary sentence
	 * followed by a more detailed description. Use the `@param` tag to describe
	 * each parameter and the `@return` tag for the return value (if applicable).
	 * Use the `@throws` tag to document any exceptions that may be thrown. 4. Use
	 * Inline Tags: Inline tags such as `{@code}`, `{@link}`, and `{@linkplain}` can
	 * be used to provide additional context or link to related elements. For
	 * example, use `{@code}` to highlight code snippets within the documentation.
	 * 5. Provide Examples: Including code examples in your Javadoc comments can
	 * greatly enhance their usefulness. Show typical usage scenarios and
	 * demonstrate how to use the element being documented. 6. Keep Comments Up to
	 * Date: It's important to keep your Javadoc comments up to date as the code
	 * evolves. Whenever you make changes to the code, review the associated Javadoc
	 * and update it accordingly to reflect the current behavior. 7. Be Consistent:
	 * Follow a consistent style and naming convention throughout your Javadoc
	 * comments. This helps maintain readability and makes it easier for others to
	 * understand and navigate your code. 8. Avoid Redundancy: Don't repeat
	 * information that is already evident from the code itself. Javadoc comments
	 * should provide additional information and context that cannot be easily
	 * inferred from the code. 9. Review and Validate: Take the time to review your
	 * Javadoc comments for accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Validate that the
	 * comments accurately reflect the behavior of the code. 10. Use Tools and IDE
	 * Support: Take advantage of tools and IDE features that can assist you in
	 * generating and validating Javadoc comments. IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and
	 * Eclipse have built-in support for Javadoc generation and can help you adhere
	 * to the best practices. By following these best practices, you can ensure that
	 * your Javadoc comments are informative, consistent, and helpful to other
	 * developers who will be using or maintaining your code.
